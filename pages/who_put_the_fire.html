          Memory of customs and traditions within which gender identities are
          created, questions the position of women in relation to their
          kitchens. “Who Put Out the Fire?’” concerns (ephemeral) artworks in
          house-kitchens in the Mattancherry/Fort Kochi area. In this project,
          along with the artists, women used their kitchens as expressions of
          their lived experiences; questioning not only their relationship with
          them, but also the possibilities of the spaces as symbols of political
          reasoning and ideologies. It extends the nuances of (generational)
          memory to aspects concerning deliberate constructs, placing
          gender-based identity in very specific roles, in society.<br />
          From an anthropological need of Kerala’s current socio-cultural
          scenario, gender roles and positioning are queried and eventually
          broken and opened up to reveal layers of her identity and existence,
          where archives of stories for generations of women of a household
          surface.

          The kitchen is viewed as a place of power and freedom, or as a place
          of bondage and constraint. This multidimensional position that the
          kitchen possesses becomes the fulcrum upon which negotiations are
          made, to deconstruct and recreate a new paradigm regarding gender
          identities and positioning in society.The films made by the
          participating artists capture the essence of the project’s process and
          intent through an artistic dialogue, which occurs between the women of
          the kitchens, the artists, and eventually the audience. The process in
          the kitchens has been transcribed here as films, each depicting a
          story, a situation, and a query.

            <p>
              Babu Eshwar Prasad trained as an artist, and completed his
              graduation and post-graduation in painting and printmaking in the
              early 1990s. He has held several exhibitions since 1996. The
              artist's mind creates and modifies visions of nature, transforming
              them into patterns and harmonious blends that no one else could
              imagine, let alone see. There is also a certain nostalgic quality
              to these psychoscapes, as if the artist is trying to recall the
              stories and fantasies of his youth, which much to his
              disappointment have lost their magic when viewed through an adult
              lens. Apart from painting, Prasad has sustained a deep interest in
              exploring other media like sculpture, sound, photography, and
              above all video and film.

            <p>
              Justin Ponmany, a transmedia artist, was born in Kerala and raised
              in Bombay, effusing memories of red soil, black sand of
              construction, salt and train journeys. In early 2000’s Ponmany,
              involved the quotidian, security hologram sticker of knowledge
              goods, ubiquitous as easy markers of authenticity, in a new media
              critique, relating its materiality and semiotics within painting.
              An analog interactive emerged sans clicks or sensors that
              underscores viewer positions vis-a vis counterintuitive material;
              e.g., material grounded in subaltern disenfranchisement,
              polarisation, conflation of myth and history by the far right
              noticably encouraging credulity in place of a dialectical
              understanding. His photo works evade the monocular, favouring an
              out-of-body, extra-terrestrial mapping.

              Lekha Narayanan was born in Kochi, Kerala in 1967. She is an
              independent artist presently based in Kochi. She has been a part
              of several exhibitions and camps and has also received several
              accolades in painting. Her focus has mostly been on women and the
              way in which the Indian patriarchal society defines or constrains
              the feminine space. In her last series of work, she mainly painted
              an arrangement of food, vessels and vegetables/fruits, sometimes
              arranged on kitchen counters. Through these ‘still life’
              arrangements, she is trying to look at the experience of cooking
              and the many things that come with the making of food, within the
              kitchen and beyond - The odyssey of the kitchen! Somewhere, by
              painting, she is making sense of this whole kitchen dilemma; the
              pleasure and the pain of it.

              Moutushi Chakraborty is a Kolkata-based artist working in the
              medium of prints, drawings, paintings, collage, and mixed-media.
              The artist visualises the feminine body as a discursive entity,
              through which she enquires into the shaping of Feminine identity
              from the Colonial to Post-Colonial era. Her works are an intrepid
              celebration of feminine grit, beauty and sensuality that refutes
              the prevalent cannons of endorsement, questioning their integrity
              with the subtlety of dark humour. Her recent body of work
              questions the context of Homeland as an extension of the physical
              presence and identity of the Feminine body in a migrant world.

              in over 100 significant shows across the globe in the last two
              decades. His visual works refer to a wide variety of sources in
              the cultural sphere and contain within them a deep conversation
              with the history of representation in visual media, fine art,
              cinema, music and architecture. Within the context of the history
              of visual representation, his current explorations include the
              architecture of the city, urbanization and urban cultures. He
              looks closely at the ideas of speed and change, intersections of
              local and the global, multiple layers of urban identities and so
              on.
