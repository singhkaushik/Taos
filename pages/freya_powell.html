              Entre-Deux is a multi-channel sound installation of collected
              memories on the notion of home and displacement. I often feel that
              I exist somewhere in between, neither here nor there. Elsewhere.
              No doubt a common feeling for people who have lived in more than
              one country. I wonder, how do we define ‘home’? Is it a place?
              Perhaps in our mother country or where we have settled in our
              current home. Is it a feeling? Perhaps found in the warmth of
              family. Or, is it a memory? A smell or a sound that triggers us to
              reminisce on something that once was. Through a participatory
              process I received anonymously written musings at home, I then
              employed new voices to read them and will present them in an
              interwoven sound installation. As distinctive as each iteration
              is, there are a few underlying collective notions: Home is a place
              where… From the place that I was born… The closer we come to
              finding… To the comfort and familiarity of… These notions of
              origination, return, and security makes up chapters of voices,
              which will be projected into the exhibition space through standing
              speakers. Where one voice pauses, another chimes in offering their
              perspective.
