              My sound installation is based on two field recordings made in
              Budapest, Hungary where I live. The two materials had been
              recorded in the same place but at different times. The first one
              was during the pandemic restrictions (we had the possibility to
              visit markets and other public facilities while keeping strict
              rules), and the second one was after the strict regulations were
              over but when public places still remained quiet. The place of the
              recordings is the largest and oldest Hungarian market hall. The
              Grand Market Hall in Budapest was built in 1896 and since then it
              has played an important role in the capital's busy life. The hall
              is situated next to the Danube River; in days of yore small ships
              could ply the building's basement through an underground stream.
              The sounds captured resonate with the nuances of the building in
              its original form, it represents the acoustics of the 19th century
              which the listener can now experience, a possibility only when the
              market fell silent. During the pandemic everything changed, and so
              did sounds. Public buildings seemed to be perfect places to grasp
              the sound of the absence of people, the sound of silence. Any
              other time, the soundscape is a buzzy environment with sounds from
              various sources. The gaping silence which persisted for the last
              two years lured me to create an acoustic illusion of vivid life in
              the middle of the pandemic as I mixed the two recordings to create
              the illusion of people around me. The mix of the two recordings
              symbolically overwrote the memory of the pandemic’s frozen world.

              <b>Balint Komenczi</b> (1974, Hungary), is a musician, sound

              important elements of his practice, besides the application of
              advanced technology for music and sound construction. He allows
