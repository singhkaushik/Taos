              "From here to there" is a migrating sound piece created by artists
              Denise Lee and Eleftheria Panousi. What makes the difference
              between a model minority and a threat? Why do we forget so easily
              the root causes of forced migration? Why do people leave their
              homes to find their place in other societies? Who has the power?
              From the Pontics of the Black Sea to the Chinese diaspora, this
              collaborative, migrating sound piece wanders through the city,
              weaving together the micro and the macro and drawing on
              generational memory through changes in location and context. Found
              audio provides a sonic, historical, and cultural backdrop for the
              text, while the artists draw from their own heritages of migration
              and intersperse personal and familial narratives with historical
              and political context, connecting these histories by questioning
              current attitudes toward migration.

              Born in the US to Taiwanese parents before migrating to Hong Kong
              where she spent her early life, <b>Denise Lee</b> moved back to
              the US to obtain a BFA at Rhode Island School of Design for
              Furniture Design with a concentration in Nature Culture
              Sustainability Studies, focusing on postcolonial theory and
              literature. She has since lived and worked in Peru, Japan, and
              Germany, where she is now based, having received an MFA at
              Bauhaus-Universität Weimar in Public Art and New Artistic
              Strategies. With a background in public art, post-colonial
              studies, civic education, and object making, Denise creates and
              facilitates physical and non-physical spaces for connection and
              dialogue with the intention of dismantling the divisions and
              miscommunications complicit in the maintenance of hierarchical
              systems. She is now working at the intersection of oral history,
              space making, decoloniality, sound, video and text in relation to
              diaspora and emotionality in urban space, attempting to understand
              how we inhabit the complexities of modernity.

              <b>Eleftheria Panousi </b>was born in Athens, Greece in 1992. She
              has practised dancing, vocals and music from a young age and uses
              elements of those fields in her current art practice. From 2012 to
              2017 she studied Fine Arts at the Aristotle University of
              Thessaloniki in Greece, and graduated from the MFA Public Art and
              New Artistic Strategies program at the Bauhaus University of
              Weimar in Germany in 2020. She has led and participated in
              exhibitions and workshops since 2014 and her work has been
              exhibited among others at the Neues Bauhaus Museum of Weimar,
              Schiller Museum Weimar, Athens and the Epidaurus Festival in
              Greece, and MOMus museums Thessaloniki, Greece. The mediums she
              uses vary depending on the project, but the core of her practice
              consists mainly of video, sound, narration and performance.
              Recently, she has been working more intensively on short films.
