              Marked by loss, isolation and yet ultimately optimism, Hey Angels
              is a document of the inherent subjectivity in memories and
              storytelling, ultimately questioning whether differentiating
              between truth and subjectivity matters. The artist was
              commissioned by Sam Boullier to make a few original score pieces
              for his experimental documentary/fiction film Hey Angels. To
              create the soundtrack, he was provided sounds from the valley and
              field recordings captured by Sam and was instructed to create a
              sound composition that took sonic elements of these memories and
              interplayed them with music. Creating contemplative textures that
              recapitulated the field recordings and imbued them with
              long-winding melodies, layers of processing and abstraction were
              used to reimagine the songwriting process into a speculative,
              film-scoring technique.
