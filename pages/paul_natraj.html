              ‘Cobblestones & Kitchari’, may give us a unique insight into the
              relationship between recorded sound, memory, and identity, with
              regard to personal rituals of listening and coping with grief.
              Keightley and Pickering argue that ‘what is remembered changes,
              and what is experienced changes what is remembered.’ (Keightley
              and Pickering, 2006). In this conception, creating memory around
              acts of listening is a dynamic, non-generic and labile process,
              especially when connected to the emotion of a traumatic event. The
              memory of a song then is the merging of spaces, places and
              objects, it is skewed repetition, it is voices unremembered,
              fragile and moving, timbres rather than words, one-sided
              conversation, echoes and the liminal intersections of dreams,
              perception, reality and emotion, as Connor reminds us ‘we hear…the
              event of the thing, not the thing itself.’ (Connor, 2001)
              'Cobblestones & Kitchari' was written over several years just
              after my father passed away in Jan 2013. All the source material
              and compositional choices on the record are related to him and his
              sonic memories. Each track constitutes a personal ritual of
              remembrance, where the manipulations of recorded sound are used to
              co-produce a memory of sound which tries to locate a moment of
              listening but is aware of its fleeting nature. These sonic
              memories coalesce around words, move across worlds and drift as
              people do, into and out of our senses, becoming either absent or
              present or sometimes both. The sounds add to the layers of
              identity that we accrue, over time, they become tangled into the
              fabric of who we are and therefore inform the rituals of our
              everyday lives.

              <b> Paul Natraj</b> holds a practice-led PhD in Sound Studies from
              the University of Sussex. The work, ‘You Sound Like a Broken
              Record’, was voted in the top ten experimental albums of the year
              by 'A Closer Listen' magazine 2018. His work explores musical
              materiality, memory, the personal stories attached to music, and
              how our relationship with listening and the listened to, changes
              over time. His work thinks about the rhizomatic connectivity of
              music and how the dialogue between times, places and spaces open
              fractures through which to listen differently to the everyday. He
              has exhibited internationally and had a solo show at Prism
              Contemporary, Blackburn. He has published articles in ‘The
              Routledge Companion to Sound Studies’ and ‘The Bloomsbury Handbook
              of Sonic Methodologies’. He is a regular contributor to the online
              music magazine, Inverted Audio and has written for Soundest
              fanzine. His sound works have been featured on BBC Radio 3’s Late
              Junction, Resonance Extra, Radiophrenia, Berlin Community Radio,
              Threads Radio, NTS, and The Wire’s Adventures in Sound and Music.
