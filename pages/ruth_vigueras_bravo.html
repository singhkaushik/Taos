              This sound piece is framed within the concepts of territory,
              migration and memory; within a Latin American context. It shows
              the geopolitical situation on the border of Mexico with the United
              States of America. It concerns the thousands of Mexicans who cross
              the border after their much longed-for "American dream". Those
              lucky ones who fulfil their dream, others, thousands of migrants,
              who died trying to cross the border; killed by the US immigration
              police. There are countless ‘border stories’ in the north of my
              country; migration being one of the most important problems in
              Mexico, a consequence of uneven economic development, coupled with
              other types of conflicts; the trafficking of drugs, children,
              women, organs, and the displacement of peasants who have emigrated
              to big cities. My interest in migration issues as a Mexican
              citizen evokes the reminiscences of transience, the footprint, the
              memory and the traces that are forgotten at the border, those
              relating to border restrictions, territory, and diverse policies
              which contribute to rejection and racism.

              <b>Ruth Vigueras Bravo</b> (Mexico City, Mexico), Ruth Vigueras
              Bravo is a Mexican visual artist whose work focuses on performance
              art and photography. She holds a BFA and an MFA. Ruth’s
              performance work characterizes urban Site-Specific interventions
              with social and political connotations, coming from a process of
              autoethnographic research in which the body acts as an
              interlocutor in the public space. Due to her social interest, she
              teaches workshops, special courses, as well as performance and
              photography seminars. She also engages the community at the
              national and international levels by creating various electronic
              and printed publications, with essays on contemporary art and
              photography. She has participated in various performance and
              action art festivals in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,
              Spain, United States, Italy, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Portugal,
              South Korea, Thailand and Venezuela. She was a fellow at the
              National Council for Culture and the Arts in Mexico (CONACULTA)
              and the Postgraduate in Arts and Design at the National Autonomous
              University of Mexico (UNAM)
